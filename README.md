1. Game Introduction
In this game, you will be given a target number and (4) gemstones (Blue, Red, Green and Yellow). The 4 gemstones will be assigned a unique, random number, but you do not know the value assigned to the gemstones. 

Your starting score is 0. As you select the gemstones, the hidden value will be added to your score. You can select any combination of gemstones and you can select a gemstone multiple times.

The goal of the game is to get your score to match the target number without going over. If your score is the same as the target number, you win. If your score is greater than teh target score, you lose. The game will keep track of the number of times you win and lose.

2. Instructions
The game starts when you first open or refresh the page. Either action will reset the number of wins and losses, establish a new target and reset your score to 0. This should only be done when you want to start the game from scratch. 

Each round of the game will establish a new target value and different, unique values for the gemstones. These will be constant for that round of the game.

To play the game, select gemstones to increase your score. Keep selecting gemstones until your score matches the target number or is greater than the target, at which point, the game will announce that you won or lost that round. 

When you win or lose, a button will appear next to the gemstones that will allow you to start the next round. The button will be hidden during normal game play.

Hint - As you play, try to determine the values assigned to the different gemstones so you can determine which combination will get you to the target.
